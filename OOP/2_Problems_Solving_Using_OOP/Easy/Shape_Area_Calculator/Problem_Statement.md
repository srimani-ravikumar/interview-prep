## Shape Area Calculator
    - **Problem Statement:** Build a system representing various geometric shapes that can compute areas. The system should allow multiple types of shapes to be handled interchangeably.
    - **OOP Concepts Tested:** Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
    - **Optional Requirements:** Use an abstract shape representation; store different shapes in a single collection to compute areas dynamically.
