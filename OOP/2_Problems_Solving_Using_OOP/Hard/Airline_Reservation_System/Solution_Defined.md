# ✈️ AIRLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM

## **Real-Time Simulation — Srimani at the Airport**

It’s 7:30 AM.
Srimani stands at Bangalore Airport, holding his backpack and confidence — ready to fly to Mumbai for an interview.

He opens the *AirSky Reservation App* (the system you're building).
He selects a **DomesticFlight**, chooses seat *12B*, pays using **UPIPayment**, gets an e-ticket, and boards.

Later, he books an **InternationalFlight** to Singapore for an upcoming tech fest, this time paying using **CardPayment**.

Flight overbooked?
No problem — the system detects it and moves you to a priority queue because you’re an early booker.

This is the simulation your OOP system must support.
