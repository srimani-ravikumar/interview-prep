# ✅ **Real-Time Simulation Story with Srimani**

**Srimani** arrives at the **Grand Palace Hotel** after attending a late-night cricket practice session.

> “I need a quiet Single Room for two days,” Srimani says.

The receptionist uses the **Hotel Management System** you built.

1. The system scans all rooms.
2. **Room 101 (Single Room)** is free.
3. It auto-generates a booking ID:
   **`487e-fda7-5bc1-99ac`**.
4. The system marks the room as **Booked**.
5. Staff receives a notification:

   > *New Booking → Room 101*

Now Srimani goes to practice the next day…
After **2 days**, he comes back for checkout.

The system calculates:

```
Price per day = ₹2000
Days = 2
Total = ₹4000
```

Staff receives:

> *Checkout → Room 101*

Srimani pays the bill and smiles:

> “This system works smoother than my cover-drive!” 😄
