This repository contains works that was involved in the process of upskilling or interview preparation of myself.
Primarily focuses on general programming concepts(not on language specific) like below:
1. OOP
2. Software Design Principles
3. Software Design Patterns
4. Data Structures Implementation
5. Algorithms Implementation
6. Low Level System Design
7. Computer Networks Notes & Projects
8. Operating Systems Notes & Projects

Note: I will use popular strictly typed OOP languages like C#, JavaScript, Java for exhibiting the above skills (which I am quite familiar with ðŸ˜…)
