# Building a Solid and Rigid Foundation!

This repository contains my personal works involved in upskilling and building thought process on what really "Software Engineering" is all about :).  
The primary focus is on **general programming concepts** rather than language-specific implementations.  

## Topics Covered

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
2. **Software Design Principles**
3. **Software Design Patterns**
4. **Data Structures Implementation**
5. **Algorithms Implementation**
6. **Low-Level System Design**
7. **Computer Networks Notes & Projects**
8. **Operating Systems Notes & Projects**

## Note

- The focus is on clarity, understanding, and practical application for skill development and rather focusing on the cream layer called "Tech Stack"
